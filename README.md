description: Ore Breaking Broadcaster

<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/50125b8f011245730853937a35d809f8.png">

A simple plugin that will broadcast whenever a player breaks the following ores:


GOLD_ORE

DIAMOND_ORE

EMERALD_ORE


Designed to be less spammy than other plugins of this nature. Will only broadcast once per player per ore, Until a different player/ore is broken.


This is my first plugin :)
