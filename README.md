description: Ore Breaking Broadcaster


A simple plugin that will broadcast whenever a player breaks the follow ores:


GOLD_ORE

DIAMOND_ORE

EMERALD_ORE


Designed to be less spammy than other plugins of this nature. Will only broadcast once per player per ore, Until a different player/ore is broken.


This is my first plugin :)
